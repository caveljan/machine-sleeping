What gives pause about sleep is that more than one find "the strongest support for a primary function of sleep goes to learning and memory". [1]

Naturally, since we do not grasp the fundamental nature of learning, memory, intelligence, [wisdom](https://github.com/caveljan/artificial-wisdom), or sleep, we ought to try to (re)produce these mechanisms in a controlled entity, a machine. Machine Sleeping would then be a tool in the arsenal of what tends to be called Machine Learning.

## Prolegomenon to a Counting of Sheep

What is the phenomenon that a human goes through roughly every 24 hours? He/she breathes, and plays, and works, then they feel tired, therefore they lie in a safe environment on a horizontal surface, close their eyes, fight for a bit the urge of thinking randomly, then suddenly but without any ability to tell when, the human loses the control of the body, disappears, becomes an object, and generally continues to be in that state for the next 7-8 hours, when just as suddenly, they start to come back into control, they appear, become a subject.

What happens in those 7-8 hours is subject to debate, but it is certain that once one goes through that state they become better able to handle the next 12-16 hours, after which the cycle repeats. Furthermore, it starts to become certain that some functions, such as learning, are strengthened after this process regularly called sleep is repeated on a longer time span.

Nothing new so far, merely a description of the current state, and now I must ask: how could a machine go to sleep? It is certain that straightforwardly powering down the machine is more akin to killing someone than to sleep (although a different word should be invented since the machine can be powered back up and start from the same point, as if nothing happened — sleekil?, killeep?). It is also certain that simply running a command such as `sleep 10` to pause the machine for 10 seconds is a pale surrogate to what actual sleep would entail.

What appears to be needed is to model a certain process that happens 'naturally', which needs to happen or else, to have a certain 'daily energy budget' which the machine consumes as work is performed, and come night, to have the machine go to sleep as (if) tired and in need of replenishing its powers. And while the machine rests in somekind of electric limbo, to have the internal state of the actions performed with the energy budget, in the previous day, but also in the past, far and close, reassembled, remodelled, recombined, looking for non-answers to unasked questions. For a brief moment in time the machine needs to become unreasonable, as if every computation is a catched error, while the meta-process records and enhances itself through aberrations and slight alterations.

What should we expect from Machine Sleeping? First of all, as the machine demonstrated on general computability, it should be fast. If a human sleep requires 7-8 hours, a machine should be expected to sleep 7-8 seconds, perhaps even less, and 'feel' just as 'rested' as the human feels after a good night's sleep. Secondly, we should expect the nightmares. Not all the sleeps one takes are restful. It is however to be discussed here on the benefit of nightmares. For a human, a nightmare such as being chased by a wild animal, is a costless, highly important, educational lesson: the costlessness being that of remaining alive while the animal starts eating you and you wake up sweating. A machine's nightmare should also be expected to be a costless educational opportunity.

The Daily Energy Budget (`DEB`) should be somewhat objective in nature, however a note of arbitrariness remains (how much should a `for` loop be? `2 debs`? `10`?).
