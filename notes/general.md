A machine Circadian Rhythm will necessarily be much lesser than 24 hours (hence why a better naming should be used: Circadian - about/around a day - Rhythm -> Circament - about/around a moment - Rhythm).

The 'Day' part of the Rhythm will consist in `spend`ing the Daily Energy Budget (`DEB`) while the 'Night' part will consist in `replenish`ing the budget. When `spend`ing, a history of the spending actions is created, memories-like. When `replenish`ing the memories are enforced (through some mechanism to be determined).
