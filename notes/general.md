A machine Circadian Rhythm will necessarily be lesser than 24 hours (hence why a better naming should be used: Circadian - about/around a day - Rhythm -> Circament - about/around a moment* - Rhythm).

* although a moment used to mean 90 seconds in the Medieval times, here it means a short period of time

The 'Day' part of the Rhythm will consist in `spend`ing the Daily Energy Budget (`DEB`) while the 'Night' part will consist in `replenish`ing the budget. When `spend`ing, a history of the spending actions is created, memories-like. When `replenish`ing the memories are enforced (through some mechanism to be determined).


A `Compute Entity` has a `Daily Energy Budget` and is in a current phase of the `Circament Rhythm`
